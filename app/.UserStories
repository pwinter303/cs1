Questions To Be Answered
- Where CAN I go - given SAT, ACT, Class Rank, GPA
- Where do I WANT to go - define criteria (eg: location, sports, etc)
- Which ones should I see on my trip.

ToDo:
- Add rowing clubs to Sports table
- Include acceptance rates in the college list
- Include REACH, MATCH, SAFETY in the college list (if scores are provided)
- Rework the college trip page... need to improve the flow.
- May want to add rows to Admissions so that there is a 1:1 relationship with institutions. Or add an acceptance col to Institutions and populate it where possible with admission info.
